**Problem Description**  
Given an integer array **A** of size **N**, find the first repeating element in it.

We need to find the element that occurs **more than once** and whose index of the first occurrence is the **smallest**.  
If there is no repeating element, return -1.

---

**Problem Constraints**
- `1 <= N <= 10^5`
- `1 <= A[i] <= 10^9`

---

**Input Format**
- The first and only argument is an integer array **A** of size **N**.

---

**Output Format**
- Return an integer denoting the first repeating element, or -1 if none exists.
