# Q2. Continuous Sum Query
---
## üöÄ Introduction
This problem involves efficiently updating ranges in an array based on multiple donations, and then calculating the final total for each beggar. It demonstrates the use of the **difference array** technique for range updates.

## üìù Problem Description
There are **A** beggars sitting in a row outside a temple. Each beggar initially has an empty pot. When devotees come to the temple, they donate some amount of coins to these beggars. Each devotee gives a fixed amount of coin (based on their faith and ability) to some **K** beggars sitting next to each other.

Given the amount **P** donated by each devotee to the beggars ranging from **L** to **R** index, where **1** <= **L** <= **R** <= **A**, find out the final amount of money in each beggar's pot at the end of the day, assuming they don't fill their pots by any other means.

For ith devotee, `B[i][0] = L`, `B[i][1] = R`, `B[i][2] = P`, given by the 2D array **B**.

---
## ‚öôÔ∏è Problem Constraints
- **A:** `1 <= A <= 2 * 10^5`
- **L, R:** `1 <= L <= R <= A`
- **P:** `1 <= P <= 10^3`
- **len(B):** `0 <= len(B) <= 10^5`

---
## üìù Input Format
- The first argument is a single integer `A`.
- The second argument is a 2D integer array `B`.

---
## üì§ Output Format
- Return an array (0-based indexing) that stores the total number of coins in each beggar's pot.

## üìö Example
### Input:
```plaintext
A = 5
B = [[1, 2, 10], [2, 3, 20], [2, 5, 25]]
```
