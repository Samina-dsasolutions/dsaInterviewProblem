## 📝 Problem Description
Given an array **A** of integers, where all elements occur twice except for one element, find that single unique element.

**Note:** Your solution should:
- Have linear runtime complexity (`O(N)`).
- Not use extra memory (`O(1)` space complexity).

---

## ⚙️ Problem Constraints
- `1 <= |A| <= 2,000,000`
- `0 <= A[i] <= INTMAX`

---

## 📝 Input Format
- The input contains a single array **A**.

---

## 📤 Output Format
- Return the integer that occurs once in the array.

---

## 📚 Example
### Input 1:
```plaintext
A = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
```
