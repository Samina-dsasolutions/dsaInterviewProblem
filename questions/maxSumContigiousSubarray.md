# Max Sum Contiguous Subarray

---

## Overview
This problem involves finding the maximum sum of any **non-empty contiguous subarray** within a given array of integers. It is a classic application of Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm, ensuring an efficient solution with linear time complexity.

---

## Problem Description
Given an array `A` of length `N`, your task is to determine the maximum possible sum of any contiguous subarray of `A`.

---

## Constraints
- **Array Length:** `1 <= N <= 10^6`
- **Element Range:** `-1000 <= A[i] <= 1000`

---

## Input Format
- A single array `A` containing integers.

---

## Output Format
- An integer representing the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `A`.

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
```plaintext
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, -10]
